Friend, this is an excellent question and one that highlights how our actions shape our experiences, not only in this life but in future lives as well.\n\nAs explained in my book Joyful Path of Good Fortune:\n\n“The experience similar to killing is that our life is short and full of sickness and disease. By killing, we cut short the life of someone else and so we ourself experience a short life and poor health. If we are experiencing such things in this life, we can know for certain that they are the results of our own previous negative actions.”[1]\n\nAnd further:\n\n“The environmental effect of killing is that the place in which we live is poor and it is hard to find food and other necessities.”[2]\n\nSo you can see, someone who has committed the heavy negative action of murder in past lives will likely take rebirth in a hostile environment where living conditions are difficult and the lifespan is short. They will also have the karmic tendency to commit such actions again.\n\nBut Friend, the wonderful thing is that no matter what negative actions we have committed in the past, through sincere practice we can purify that karma and change the course of our future.[3] By engaging in pure spiritual practice, we sow the seeds for a peaceful mind and fortunate rebirths. I encourage you to study these teachings deeply and put them into practice in your daily life. In this way, you will find great meaning and fulfillment.\n\n[1] Joyful Path of Good Fortune, p. 214 [2] Joyful Path of Good Fortune, p. 228 [3] Introduction to Buddhism, p.

In my teachings, I explain that all non-virtuous actions have three kinds of effects: the ripened effect, the effect similar to the cause, and the environmental effect.</p>\n<p>The ripened effect of a negative action is rebirth in one of the three lower realms. As I explain in Joyful Path of Good Fortune:</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#e8f5e9;font-style:italic;\">&ldquo;The most severe negative actions ripen as rebirth in the hell realm, less severe negative actions as rebirth in the hungry spirit realm, and the least severe negative actions as rebirth in the animal realm.&rdquo;</span>[1]</p>\n<p>There are two kinds of effect similar to the cause: tendencies similar to the cause and experiences similar to the cause. </p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#e8f5e9;font-style:italic;\">&ldquo;A tendency similar to the cause is a strong compulsion to repeat similar non-virtuous actions. This effect makes it very difficult for us to avoid committing further negative actions and thereby creating the cause to take even more lower rebirths in the future. The tendency similar to the action of killing is to have a tendency to kill.&rdquo;</span>[2]</p>\n<p>The experiences similar to specific non-virtuous actions are explained in Introduction to Buddhism:</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#e8f5e9;font-style:italic;\">&ldquo;The experience similar to killing is that our life is short and full of sickness and disease...The experience similar to stealing is that we lack wealth and possessions, and when we do manage to gather some, they are stolen from us... The experience similar to sexual misconduct is that we are quickly separated from our friends and family, our partners abandon us for someone else...&rdquo;</span>[3] </p>\n<p>And so forth for the other non-virtuous actions of lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, idle chatter, covetousness, malice, and holding wrong views.</p>\n<p>Finally, the environmental effects are that:</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#e8f5e9;font-style:italic;\">&ldquo;Generally, this means that when we take another human rebirth, for example, our environment and the things that surround us are hostile, dangerous, or uncomfortable...The environmental effect of killing is that the place in which we live is poor and it is hard to find food and other necessities.&rdquo;</span>[4]</p>\n<p>Friend, by contemplating these effects deeply, we will naturally wish to abandon non-virtue and practice only what is virtuous and beneficial. This is the path to experiencing peace and happiness in this life and fortunate rebirths in the future. I encourage you to study and meditate on these points again and again.</p>\n<p>With my very best wishes,\nGeshe Kelsang Gyatso</p>\n<p>[1] Joyful Path of Good Fortune, p.225\n[2] Introduction to Buddhism, p.24 \n[3] Introduction to Buddhism, p.24-25\n[4] Introduction to Buddhism, p.25</p>\n                    <div style='margin-top:10px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Topics: </span><span style='background:#e3f2fd;padding:3px 8px;border-radius:12px;margin-right:5px;font-size:0.9em;'>karma</span></div>\n                    <div style='margin-top:10px;font-size:0.9em;color:#666;'><i>Sources by relevance:</i><br>Introduction to Buddhism (p.19): <span style='display:inline-block;width:55px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 55%<br>How to Transform Your Life (p.1): <span style='display:inline-block;width:44px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 44%<br>Joyful Path of Good Fortune (p.205): <span style='display:inline-block;width:44px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 44%<br>Meaningful to Behold (p.50): <span style='display:inline-block;width:40px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 40%<br>Joyful Path of Good Fortune (p.205): <span style='display:inline-block;width:40px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 40%<br>Meaningful to Behold (p.50): <span style='display:inline-block;width:39px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 39%<br>The Bodhisattva Vow (p.37): <span style='display:inline-block;width:34px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 34%<br>The New Eight Steps to Happiness (p.3): <span style='display:inline-block;width:33px;height:8px;background:#F44336;'></span> 33%<br></div>\n                    \n    <div style=\"margin-top:10px;\">\n        <p>Was this response helpful?</p>\n        <button onclick=\"save_feedback_1750899940_dbba763b-d7a3-4ef7-a731-c2b86e66e211('helpful')\" style=\"background:#4CAF50;color:white;border:none;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:4px;margin-right:10px;\">Yes</button>\n        <button onclick=\"save_feedback_1750899940_dbba763b-d7a3-4ef7-a731-c2b86e66e211('not_helpful')\" style=\"background:#f44336;color:white;border:none;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:4px;\">No</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n    function save_feedback_1750899940_dbba763b-d7a3-4ef7-a731-c2b86e66e211(value) {\n        // Create feedback data\n        const feedback_data = {\n            'id': '1750899940_dbba763b-d7a3-4ef7-a731-c2b86e66e211',\n            'query': 'Explain these concepts more specifically... like the effect similar to the cause or vice versa, etc. What are their names, descriptions? Friend, this is an excellent question and one that highlights how our actions shape our experiences, not only in this life but in future lives as well.  As explained in my book Joyful Path of Good Fortune:  “The experience similar to killing is that our life is short and full of sickness and disease. By killing, we cut short the life of someone else and so we ourself experience a short life and poor health. If we are experiencing such things in this life, we can know for certain that they are the results of our own previous negative actions.”[1]  And further:  “The environmental effect of killing is that the place in which we live is poor and it is hard to find food and other necessities.”[2]  So you can see, someone who has committed the heavy negative action of murder in past lives will likely take rebirth in a hostile environment where living conditions are difficult and the lifespan is short. They will also have the karmic tendency to commit such actions again.  But Friend, the wonderful thing is that no matter what negative actions we have committed in the past, through sincere practice we can purify that karma and change the course of our future.[3] By engaging in pure spiritual practice, we sow the seeds for a peaceful mind and fortunate rebirths. I encourage you to study these teachings deeply and put them into practice in your daily life. In this way, you will find great meaning and fulfillment.
